# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions, SonarQube, Jacoco, and Azure WebApp Deployment

[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=Joao-Lucas-de-Oliveira-Lima_github-actions-azure-pipeline&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=Joao-Lucas-de-Oliveira-Lima_github-actions-azure-pipeline)

## Overview

This project provides a REST API that supports CRUD operations for the **USER** entity, along with a greeting endpoint. The API implements Clean Architecture and includes unit and integration tests. Architectural tests are performed using ArchUnit.

A CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions, featuring:
1. Unit and integration tests executed via Maven (`verify`), with test coverage reports generated by Jacoco.
2. Test data and code quality metrics sent to SonarQube Cloud Scanner.
3. Automatic deployment to an Azure WebApp service upon successful completion of all pipeline stages.

## Project Setup

### Requirements for the Production Branch
1. The production branch (`main`) is subject to specific restrictions, such as enabling **Require status checks to pass** and **Require a pull request before merging**. These settings ensure that workflows are validated through pull requests before code is merged.

### Creating the CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
name: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - test
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
      - reopened

jobs:
  test_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Set up JDK 21
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '21'
          distribution: 'temurin'
```
This pipeline includes a `test_and_deploy` job running on an Ubuntu virtual machine. The `workflow_dispatch` event allows manual pipeline execution. The [actions/checkout@v4](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action clones the repository, and `fetch-depth: 0` ensures full commit history. [actions/setup-java@v4](https://github.com/actions/setup-java) installs JDK 21.

## Building the Project

### Caching Configuration
```yaml
- name: Cache SonarQube packages
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.sonar/cache
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-sonar
    restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-sonar

- name: Cache Maven packages
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.m2
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-m2-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
    restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-m2
```

### Build and Quality Analysis
```yaml
- name: Build and Analyze
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
  run: mvn install -B verify jacoco:report org.sonarsource.scanner.maven:sonar-maven-plugin:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=Joao-Lucas-de-Oliveira-Lima_github-actions-azure-pipeline

- name: Set JAR file name
  run: |
    echo "JAVA_BUILD=$(ls target | grep '\.jar$')" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```
These steps build the project, run unit and integration tests, generate coverage reports with Jacoco, and send data to SonarQube for quality analysis. More details are available in the official [documentation](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/10.7/devops-platform-integration/github-integration/adding-analysis-to-github-actions-workflow/).

## Deploying to Azure WebApp
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Azure Web Apps
  uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v3
  env:
    AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH: './target'
  with:
    app-name: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME }}
    publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
    package: '${{ env.AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}/${{ env.JAVA_BUILD }}'
```
Deployment is done to an Azure WebApp service. Authentication uses **Publish Profile** with basic authentication enabled on Azure. More details are available in the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions?tabs=applevel%2Cjava).
